# Face Recognization

This isn't an efficient way(Efficinet Way is to use ```Neural Networks```),but it can serve the purpose

## Requirements for Running this

- OpenCV 2 (Doesnt Run on OpenCV3)

- Python 2.7 and above

- NumPy Library

Thats it.You are ready to GO !!

# USAGE

> ```datasetCreator.py``` is used to Get the User Registered with an ID.
> If same ID is repeated,the Database will be Overriden.


>```trainer.py``` is used to train the Machine.Without Training,You Cannot
> Go ahead with Face Recognization

>With ```detector.py``` ,Sit back and enjoy the Face Recognization

# NOTE

The Directory ```dataSet``` and the above mentioned scripts must be in the Same Directory

```dataSet``` directory is used to store the DataSets of the Users,Tampering this may not lead
to correct results



### Tested On
(32-bit) Python 2.7.12 on (64-bit)Windows 10
